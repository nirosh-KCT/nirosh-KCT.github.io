      <h2>Tradition of Tamilnadu</h2>
      <p>
        The state of Tamilnadu has an unrivalled history of handloom tradition
        that dates back to prehistoric ages. Its early origin and development
        through ages can be traced through various Tamil literary sources like
        Silapathigaram, Purananooru, Agananooru, Kurundhogai, Perumpanatrupadai,
        Nedunelvadai and Mullaipattu testifying the glorious tradition that
        changes and reshapes according to the creativity of the artisan and the
        demands of the rulers and market.

      <h2>Coimbatore</h2>
      <p>
        The western Tamilnadu of today with special reference to the Coimbatore
        region has been well known for its handloom textile of cotton and silk
        for over 2000 years. The trading Romans were keen importers of textile
        from here and the heritage continues to make this region as a hotspot
        for textile globally even today. The rich handloom heritage of the
        region is still surviving, but in ways it is also languishing due to the
        enormous impact of the machines. The major crop cultivated in the rich
        black soil of Coimbatore has laid foundation for textile industry. First
        textile mill came up as far back as 1888. India’s 15 % textile mills are
        situated in and around Coimbatore. Textile machines were produced here.
